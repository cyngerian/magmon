# Deck Versioning Implementation Summary

## Starting Point

We began with a Magic: The Gathering commander game tracker application that had the following features:
- User authentication and profile management
- Deck creation and management
- Game scheduling and registration
- Match submission and approval
- Player statistics

The application was missing a key feature: the ability to track different versions of a deck over time. This was important because decks evolve as players make changes, and there was a need to preserve the exact state of a deck when it was used in a game.

## Implementation Overview

We implemented a comprehensive deck versioning system that allows users to:
1. Create new versions of their decks
2. View the history of versions for a deck
3. See detailed information about each version
4. Register for games with a specific version of a deck
5. Record which version of a deck was used in a match

## Backend Changes

### Database Schema Updates

1. Added a new `deck_versions` table with the following fields:
   - `id`: Primary key
   - `deck_id`: Foreign key to the deck
   - `version_number`: Sequential version number
   - `decklist_text`: The full decklist for this version
   - `notes`: Notes about changes made in this version
   - `created_at`: Timestamp when the version was created

2. Added a `current_version_id` field to the `decks` table to track which version is current

3. Added a `deck_version_id` field to:
   - `game_registrations` table: To record which version of a deck was registered for a game
   - `match_players` table: To record which version of a deck was used in a match

### API Endpoints

Added new API endpoints:
1. `GET /decks/{deck_id}/versions`: Get all versions of a deck
2. `GET /decks/{deck_id}/versions/{version_id}`: Get details for a specific version
3. `POST /decks/{deck_id}/versions`: Create a new version of a deck

Updated existing endpoints:
1. Modified `POST /decks` to automatically create an initial version (version 1)
2. Updated `GET /decks/{deck_id}` to include current version information
3. Enhanced `POST /games/{game_id}/registrations` to accept an optional deck version ID
4. Updated `GET /games/{game_id}/registrations` to include deck version information
5. Modified `POST /matches` to record the deck version used by each player
6. Enhanced `GET /matches/{match_id}` to include deck version information

## Frontend Changes

1. Added new API client functions:
   - `getDeckVersions`
   - `getDeckVersion`
   - `createDeckVersion`

2. Created new React components:
   - `DeckVersionsPage`: Lists all versions of a deck with creation dates, notes, and status
   - `DeckVersionDetailPage`: Shows detailed information about a specific version

3. Updated existing components:
   - Added a "Versions" link to the `DeckDetailPage`
   - Updated routing in `App.tsx` to include the new pages

4. Added UI for creating new versions:
   - Modal dialog with fields for decklist and notes
   - Pre-filled with current deck content for easy editing

## User Experience Improvements

1. Clear visual indication of which version is current
2. Easy navigation between deck details and version history
3. Ability to view the full decklist for any version
4. Version notes to document changes made in each version

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation in `DECK_VERSIONING.md` that explains:
1. The concept and benefits of deck versioning
2. The database schema changes
3. The API endpoints for working with versions
4. How to use the versioning feature as a user

## Technical Challenges Addressed

1. Ensuring data integrity across related tables
2. Maintaining backward compatibility with existing features
3. Creating an intuitive UI for version management
4. Properly handling the relationship between decks and their versions

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the versioning system could include:
1. Ability to compare different versions side by side
2. Visual diff highlighting changes between versions
3. Option to restore or revert to previous versions
4. Statistics on performance of different versions in games
5. Tagging or labeling versions for easier reference

## Conclusion

The deck versioning feature significantly enhances the application by allowing players to track the evolution of their decks over time while maintaining an accurate historical record of which deck versions were used in specific games. This adds depth to the player experience and improves the accuracy of game records and statistics.
