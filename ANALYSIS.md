# MagMon Project Analysis

*Analysis performed on: 4/6/2025, 7:57:09 PM (America/New_York, UTC-4:00)*

## Summary of Findings:

Based on the files examined (`docker-compose.yml`, `PLAN.md`, `TECHNICAL_README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `backend/app/models.py`, `backend/app/api/routes.py`, `frontend/src/App.tsx`), here's an assessment of the project:

1.  **Project:** The project is named "MagMon" and is a web application designed to track Magic: The Gathering Commander games, focusing on managing decks, games, registrations, and match results.
2.  **Technology Stack:** It uses a standard modern web stack:
    *   **Backend:** Python/Flask with SQLAlchemy/Flask-Migrate for ORM and PostgreSQL for the database.
    *   **Frontend:** React with TypeScript, using Vite for building and Axios for API communication.
    *   **Containerization:** Docker (at least for the development database).
3.  **Current Status & Implemented Features:**
    *   Despite `PLAN.md` indicating all phases of a "Game Night" refactor are "Not Started", the `TECHNICAL_README.md`, database models (`Game`, `GameRegistration`, `Match`), and API routes confirm that a significant set of features **are already implemented**:
        *   User Registration and Login.
        *   Deck Creation, Listing, and Viewing Details.
        *   Game Creation (manual), Listing, and Status Updates (e.g., Cancel).
        *   User Registration for specific Games with their Decks.
        *   Match Submission linked to a Game, including player placements.
        *   Match Listing and Viewing Details.
        *   Match Approval/Rejection workflow (backend endpoints exist).
    *   **Conclusion:** The application appears to be **functional** with the core workflow described in the `TECHNICAL_README.md`. The `PLAN.md` likely represents an **outdated plan or a future refactoring effort** centered around a "Game Night" concept, which has **not yet been implemented** (as evidenced by the lack of `GameNight` models/routes and the presence of `Game`-related ones).
4.  **Known TODOs/Next Steps:** The `TECHNICAL_README.md` lists several areas for future work, including implementing robust authentication (JWT), refining the UI, adding match history display, and potentially addressing a TypeScript error in `GamesPage.tsx`.
