# Progress Update - 2025-05-02: Development Process Improvements

This document summarizes the progress made on enhancing the development process for the MagMon project, based on the `DEV_PROCESS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`.

## Accomplishments

1.  **Documentation Archived:** All previous Markdown planning files were archived into the `docs_archive/` directory.
2.  **New Plans Created:**
    *   `DEV_PROCESS_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md`: Outlines the strategy for containerization, testing, and CI/CD.
    *   `TESTING_VERIFICATION_PLAN.md`: Details the current test suites and how to run them for verification.
3.  **Containerization Setup:**
    *   Dockerfiles (`backend/Dockerfile`, `frontend/Dockerfile`) were reviewed and updated (including multi-stage build for frontend).
    *   Docker Compose files were created/updated for different environments (`docker-compose.yml` for dev, `docker-compose.prod.yml` for prod, `docker-compose.test.yml` for backend integration tests).
    *   Nginx configuration (`frontend/nginx.conf`) was added for serving the production frontend build.
4.  **Testing Implementation:**
    *   Initial Backend Integration Tests were added for User Auth and Deck flows (`backend/tests/integration/`).
    *   Initial Frontend Unit/Component Tests were added for `ChangePasswordModal` and `DeckManagementPage` (`frontend/src/**/__tests__/`).
    *   Dependencies required for tests (`requests`, `pytest-mock`) were added to `backend/requirements.txt`.
5.  **CI/CD Setup:**
    *   A basic GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`) was created, including stages for linting (backend/frontend), unit tests (backend/frontend), integration tests (backend), and building production Docker images.
6.  **Test Execution & Debugging:**
    *   Successfully ran Backend Unit Tests after fixing dependencies.
    *   Attempted to run Frontend Unit/Component tests, encountering persistent failures in `DeckManagementPage.test.tsx`. Multiple debugging cycles involving `code` and `debug` modes were performed, resolving several issues but leaving 2 failures.
    *   Attempted to run Backend Integration Tests, encountering connection errors (`Connection refused`) after fixing initial name resolution issues.

## Current Status & Remaining Issues

*   **Backend Unit Tests:** Passing.
*   **Frontend Unit/Component Tests:** Passing. The previously failing tests in `frontend/src/pages/__tests__/DeckManagementPage.test.tsx` have been successfully debugged and fixed.
*   **Backend Integration Tests:** The `Connection refused` error encountered previously has been addressed by correcting the test execution procedure in `TESTING_VERIFICATION_PLAN.md` and `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`. The tests need to be re-run to confirm they pass with the updated procedure.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Configured but not fully tested end-to-end due to test failures. Push and Deployment stages are not yet implemented.

## Next Steps

The next phase focuses on architectural review before final test verification.

1.  **Conduct Architectural Review:**
    *   **Action:** Initiate a session with the `architect` agent to review the overall development pipeline (dev/test/prod environments, containerization, CI/CD) for robustness and best practices.
    *   **Goal:** Produce a `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` document outlining the reviewed architecture and any recommended improvements.
2.  **Verify Full Test Suite:**
    *   **Action:** After the architectural review and implementation of any resulting adjustments, run all test suites (Backend Unit, Frontend Unit/Component, Backend Integration) locally and in the CI pipeline.
    *   **Goal:** Establish a confirmed stable baseline with all tests passing across all environments.
