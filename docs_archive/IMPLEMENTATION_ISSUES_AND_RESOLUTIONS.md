# Implementation Issues and Resolutions

This document outlines the technical issues encountered during the implementation of the deck versioning feature and Games page UI improvements, how they were resolved, and the issues that still persist and need to be fixed.

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

### 1. Database Migration Issues

#### Issue
When implementing the deck versioning feature, we needed to add new tables and columns to the existing database schema. The initial migration script had errors in the foreign key relationships, particularly with the `deck_versions` table referencing the `decks` table.

#### Resolution
- Fixed the migration script to properly define the foreign key relationships
- Added proper cascade behavior to ensure data integrity when decks are deleted
- Implemented a data migration step to create initial versions for existing decks
- Added proper indexing to improve query performance

### 2. UI Component Library Mismatch

#### Issue
When creating the DeckVersionsPage component, we initially used Material UI components, but the project was actually using PicoCSS for styling.

#### Resolution
- Refactored the DeckVersionsPage component to use PicoCSS styling instead of Material UI
- Updated all UI elements to match the existing application's design language
- Ensured consistent styling across all components

### 3. API Integration Challenges

#### Issue
The frontend components needed to interact with the new API endpoints for deck versioning, but there were issues with the API client configuration and error handling.

#### Resolution
- Updated the apiClient.ts file to include the new deck versioning endpoints
- Improved error handling to provide more informative error messages
- Added proper type definitions for the API responses

### 4. Route Configuration

#### Issue
Adding new routes for the deck versioning pages caused conflicts with existing routes, particularly with parameter handling.

#### Resolution
- Reorganized the route definitions in App.tsx to ensure proper nesting
- Updated the route parameters to correctly handle deck IDs and version IDs
- Added proper authentication checks for the new routes

### 5. Data Consistency in Game Registrations

#### Issue
When a user registered for a game with a specific deck version, the system needed to ensure that the version information was properly recorded and maintained throughout the game lifecycle.

#### Resolution
- Updated the game registration process to include deck version information
- Modified the match submission process to record which version of a deck was used
- Ensured that the version information was preserved when viewing historical game data

### 6. UI Responsiveness in Games Page

#### Issue
The Games page UI improvements caused layout issues on smaller screens, particularly with the new Winner column in the games list table.

#### Resolution
- Implemented responsive design techniques to ensure proper display on all screen sizes
- Added overflow handling for long usernames in the Winner column
- Adjusted column widths to accommodate the new information

## Persistent Issues That Need to be Fixed

### 1. Deck Version Comparison Tool

#### Issue
Users currently cannot directly compare different versions of a deck side by side to see what changes were made between versions.

#### Required Fix
- Implement a comparison view that highlights additions, removals, and changes between two selected versions
- Add a "Compare" option in the versions list page
- Create a dedicated comparison page with a split view

### 2. Performance Optimization for Large Decklists

#### Issue
When a deck has many versions with large decklists, the versions page can be slow to load and navigate.

#### Required Fix
- Implement pagination for the versions list
- Add lazy loading for version details
- Optimize the database queries to reduce load times

### 3. Deck Version Restoration

#### Issue
Users cannot currently restore a previous version of a deck to make it the current version without manually copying the decklist.

#### Required Fix
- Add a "Restore" button to previous versions
- Implement the backend logic to create a new version based on a previous version
- Update the UI to reflect the restored version as the current version

### 4. Games List Filtering and Sorting

#### Issue
The Games page lacks advanced filtering and sorting options, making it difficult to find specific games or analyze trends.

#### Required Fix
- Add filter options for game status, date range, and participants
- Implement sorting by different columns (date, winner, etc.)
- Add a search function to find games by specific criteria

### 5. Mobile Responsiveness

#### Issue
While some responsive design improvements were made, the application still has usability issues on mobile devices, particularly with the deck versioning interface.

#### Required Fix
- Redesign the version creation modal for better mobile usability
- Improve touch targets for better mobile interaction
- Optimize layout for smaller screens

### 6. Data Migration for Existing Games

#### Issue
Existing games and matches don't have deck version information, which creates inconsistencies in historical data.

#### Required Fix
- Create a data migration script to associate existing game registrations with the initial version of each deck
- Update the match player records to include version information
- Add a flag or note to indicate which games have retroactively assigned version information

### 7. Error Handling Improvements

#### Issue
Some error scenarios in the deck versioning workflow are not handled gracefully, particularly network errors during version creation.

#### Required Fix
- Implement more robust error handling throughout the versioning workflow
- Add retry mechanisms for network failures
- Provide clearer error messages to users

## Conclusion

While we successfully implemented the deck versioning feature and Games page UI improvements, addressing these persistent issues would further enhance the application's functionality, performance, and user experience. The most critical issues to address are the deck version comparison tool and the performance optimization for large decklists, as these would provide the most immediate value to users.
